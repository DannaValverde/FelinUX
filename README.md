# SevenToNine Space Biology Knowledge Engine

### *A Dynamic Dashboard for NASA’s Space Bioscience Data*

## Overview

**SevenToNine Space Biology Knowledge Engine** is our team’s submission for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**, under the challenge **“Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine”**

NASA has accumulated decades of space biology experiments, generating an immense amount of valuable data. However, this information can be difficult to navigate for researchers and enthusiasts alike.

Our project aims to solve this by creating a **dynamic, AI-powered dashboard** that helps users **find, explore, and understand** NASA’s bioscience publications with clarity and ease.

Through intelligent indexing, summarization, and filtering, SevenToNine Space Biology Knowledge Engine allows users to **discover insights quickly** — bridging the gap between massive scientific archives and human curiosity.

## Challenge Description

> **Enable a new era of human space exploration!**
> Enable a new era of human space exploration! NASA has been performing biology experiments in space for decades, generating a tremendous amount of information that will need to be considered as humans prepare to revisit the Moon and explore Mars. Although this knowledge is publicly available, it can be difficult for potential users to find information that pertains to their specific interests. 
> 
> Your challenge is to build a dynamic dashboard that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge graphs, and/or other tools to summarize a set of NASA bioscience publications and enables users to explore the impacts and results of the experiments these publications describe.

## Our Vision

We aim to make space biology **accessible, understandable, and inspiring** for everyone - from scientists to students and newcomers.
Our dashboard will:

* Use **AI and natural language understanding** to summarize key insights.
* Provide **smart filtering and search** across large datasets.
* Present information visually through an **intuitive, minimalistic interface**.
* Reduce clutter and emphasize **clarity and relevance** over data overload.
