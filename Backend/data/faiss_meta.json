          "Study Protocol Description": "The RR-1 mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. Exact matched procedures were held for ground control, vivarium, and basal groups. After vehicle return, dissection of all four groups (flight, baseline, ground, vivarium) were conducted. The returned carcasses were thawed and dissected twice. The first round of carcass dissections, known as the RR1 1st thaw BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program), spanned a 2-week period in April 2015 and a 1-week period in May 2015. The RR1 2nd thaw BSP was performed in March 2016. BSP samples were dissected, frozen, and then transferred to the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA; now NBISC [NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection) for long-term storage. Tissues from forty mice were received for this study, from RR-1 through BSP/ALSDA and lumbar vertebrae (L4) were assessed for cancellous bone by microcomputed tomography. Vertebrae were preserved by wrapping specimens with single 2-ply gauze squares (1/3 of a typical tri-fold gauze pad) and dipped into PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Tissues were stored in labeled specimen containers and placed on ice, and subsequently stored at -20C.     The mCT machine used for this study was a SkyScan 1174, Bruker, Belgium. The scanning was conducted at 6.7 micrometers per pixel, x-ray intensity was 800 miliamperes, and killivolt peak was 50kvp, with frame averaging of 2. A .log file from the scanning, reconstruction, and analysis from this mCT study was submitted and available for data provenance.     This study was approved by by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Post-pubescent female C57BL/6J mice (16 weeks at launch) were exposed to 37 days of microG flight, after being flown to the ISS, and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were acclimated to NASA Rodent Food bars, lixits, and wire floors.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     An upper/lower threshold approach was used to binarize grayscale images, with a lower gray threshold of 40 and upper gray threshold of 255 (on 0-1000 scale).     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "C57BL/6 female mice (16-week-old, Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS as part of NASA’s 1st RR-1 on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft. During flight, animals were kept at an ambient temperature of 26 to 28C in a 12-hour light and dark cycle. Flight animals received water and a food bar diet specifically designed by NASA ad libitum. RR-1 mission animals were on board of the Dragon capsule for 4 days (transit time) and then spent 37 days in the ISS. Animals in the vivarium group were control animals that were housed under standard laboratory conditions. In addition, animals in the baseline group consisted of mice from the same cohorts as the flight mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch.     Within 4 hours of splashdown, flight and ground control animals were sacrificed and brains were removed and dissected. For the study focusing on the forebrain, microdissections of the entire hippocampus and primary motor cortex were performed following well-established rodent brain microdissection protocols, and a brain atlas served as a reference to ensure accuracy of brain region identification. Following brain dissection, samples were stored at −80 degrees Celsius until further analysis. Tissues used in this study consisted of the brain cortex. Brain tissue samples were obtained from by the authors through an award from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC).     Using protein lysates, a V-PLEX ECLIA kit (MSD) was used to measure the inflammatory profile in the different brain sections using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM (MSD).     Briefly, to measure the protein levels of TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10., after washing steps, the plate was incubated overnight with 50 uL of samples. The following day, after washing steps, samples were incubated in detection antibody for 2 hrs followed by 3 more washings steps and addition of 2X Read Buffer. After obtaining the quantity of protein in pg/mL using using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM, samples were then normalized to total protein loaded.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures).

In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from September 21st, 2014, to October 25th, 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice. This dataset derives results from the ECLIA assay using brain tissue.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "After vehicle return, 13–15 hours was required to perform initial health inspections and to transport the animals from their landing site in the Orenburg region of Russia to the dissection site in Moscow. BSP personnel then sacrificed mice and dissected and flash froze tissues. The authors of this study received isolated frozen tails from the post-flight mice (flight, n equals 6) and vivarium controls (control, n equals 8). The C3-C4 caudal motion segment was isolated from each specimen and thawed. The ventral side of each motion segment was marked with tissue dye to track orientation. Surrounding ligaments and soft tissues were removed to isolate the discs and vertebrae, and X-ray scans were obtained for each specimen to measure disc height as an average of three measurements taken at the center of the disc. Specimens were kept hydrated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) throughout tissue preparation.     Indication of post-flight vertebral rim fractures noted by histology prompted a mCT bone analysis. Adjacent whole motion segments were scanned using high-resolution X-ray microscopy to quantify bone mineral density and trabecular microarchitecture (mCT 50, SCANCO Medical, Bruttisellen, Switzerland). Motion segments were oriented with the longitudinal axis of the spine perpendicular to the radiation beam and scanned in 70% ethanol at a 4mm voxel size using a tube voltage of 55 kVp and an X-ray intensity of 109mA.     Image reconstruction was performed using SCANCO software and scans were analyzed using SCANCO Evaluation Program v6.5-3 to quantify bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone mineral density (BMD), and trabecular microarchitecture (trabecular number, thickness, and spacing) on each whole motion segment. Subsequently, these same analyses were performed on a trabecular compartment of bone in the metaphysis adjacent to the cranial growth plate of each vertebra to quantify changes in parameters specific to the trabecular bone. This trabecular volume of interest (VOI) was manually delineated using an irregular contour drawn a few pixels away from the endocortical surface. The VOI began just below the growth plate on the cranial end of the vertebra and extended 1mm (250 slices) towards the diaphysis. This VOI was chosen rather than isolated epiphyses because murine epiphyses are very small (\u00020.7–0.8mm3) and composed largely of cortical bone, which remodels slower than trabecular bone. The chosen VOI had a larger trabecular volume which improved our statistical power for identifying bone density changes induced by spaceflight. For all analyses, a lower threshold of 300 grayscale units was used to segregate mineralized tissue from soft tissue and scan medium, and Gaussian filters with a sigma of 0.5 and support of two were applied to remove noise. Morphometric indices were calculated using a 3D model-independent algorithm, and BMD was calculated using a linear attenuation coefficient determined by calibration with a SCANCO hydroxyapatite phantom.     The content for this dataset was extracted from a meta-analysis performed by the authors of Fu et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00147-7). The purpose of the meta-analysis was to mine the literature in order to quantify microgravity-induced changes to bone health in animals. The authors provided to ALSDA a global dataset, based upon 40 different literature-derived articles. In collaboration with the authors and the ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG), these datasets were then parsed into individual 'original' files of data. This 'original' data file is made available (so users can see original version). To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Of note, these values are groups of sample, with 'sample name 1' (group 1) having an N of 3, and 'sample name 2' (group 2) having an N of 5.     This study was approved by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Fourteen male C57BL/6 mice (19–20 weeks old) were obtained through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Six mice had flown in low Earth orbit on a 30-day microgravity Bion M1 mission and were sacrificed 13–15 h after landing.  Eight control mice were kept on the ground during the same 30-day period in standard vivarium cages (GM 500, Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy).",

          "Study Description": "Intervertebral disc herniation rates are quadrupled in astronauts following spaceflight. While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (mCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.

          "Study Protocol Description": "For the hindlimb suspension (HLS) experiments, the hindlimbs of male GSK3mKD and GSK3flox (4–6 month old) mice were suspended using a taping method where the tails of mice were taped to a copper ring attached to a steel bar that was mounted on top of a modified mouse cage. For these experiments, mice were pair-housed in the cages and had as libitum access to food and water.     HLS mice were subjected to anesthesia under isoflurane for in vivo DXA scanning.     A small animal DXA scanner (OsteoSys InSIGHT, Scintica) was used to scan the individual femur bones collected from the RR9 mission. Overall coefficient of variation of our analysis was 1.7% for BMD and 3.2% for BMC. In addition, we also performed region-specific BMD analysis for the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine from mobile and HLS GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Description": "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA Scanning assay using lumbar spine tissue from HLS mice. The lumbar spine data in this study are related to other studies using tissues from the same experiment; OSD-654 (tibia), OSD-660 (tibialis anterior), OSD-662 (soleus), OSD-663 (femur), and OSD-664 (extensor digitorum longus).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The calvariae were frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped under dry ice to our laboratory at University of California, San Diego for analysis. It should be noted that the STS-131 mission originally carried eleven adult, female, wild-type C57BL/6 mice. However, only seven were included in the current study. One calvaria suffered multiple bone fractures from inappropriate handling and storage, and was deemed unsuitable for analysis. Three were euthanized 28 h after landing instead of within 4 h, and thus were not included in our analysis. Although the addition of these three calvariae would greatly increase the sample size, we felt that since the length of stay in microgravity was only fifteen days, the three calvariae extracted after experiencing Earth's gravity for more than one entire day may not truly reflect microgravity-induced changes and may instead introduce bias to the analysis of the samples. To compensate for this decision, we also excluded three of the eleven ground control mice with the same number of caged days prior to euthanasia.     Experimental protocol conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and was approved by the Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Prior to experiments, all animals were deemed healthy by the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians.\n\nSeven 23-week-old adult, female, wild-type C57BL/6 mice representing the spaceflight group (n equals 7) experienced fifteen days of microgravity aboard the 15-day NASA shuttle mission STS-131. Eight female wild-type C57BL/6 mice, littermates of the spaceflight group, were maintained on land under normal gravitational loads and represent the control group (n equals 8). Both groups were maintained on a 12:12-hour light–dark cycle and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum, from April 4 to 20, 2010 for the flight mice and from April 6 to 22, 2010 for the ground controls. Both groups were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules with gravity or lack thereof being the primary environmental difference. All mice were weighed twice – once just prior to cage-loading, and again after cage-unloading at the termination of the 15-day period and prior to sacrifice – and the weight change of each animal was determined.\n\nAfter mission completion, the spaceflight mice were received and euthanized at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, and their tissues were harvested within 3 to 4 h of shuttle landing. The ground control mice were identically housed for the duration of the STS-131 mission beginning 48 h after launch, and were  euthanized at the termination of their experimental duration 48 h after shuttle landing. All animals were handled and dissected by members of the Biospecimen Sharing Project at NASA-KSC.     Samples were thawed and imaged on a micro-Computed Tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Kontich, Belgium). Calvariae were wrapped in tissue paper moistened with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and scanned at 9μm voxel size, applying an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200uA, and using a 0.5mm aluminum filter. Tissue Mineral Density (TMD) was determined by calibration of images against 2mm diameter hydroxyapatite (HA) rods (250 and 750 mg/cm3) with a beam hardening correction algorithm applied during image reconstruction.     Bone structure and histomorphometric parameters were visualized and determined using Skyscan software, Dataviewer, CTAn (Kontich, Belgium). A volume of interest (VOI, defined by a standardized rectangular volume measuring 18mm3, 5.5mm × 1.2mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7mm depth) was located at the center of the parietal bones by identifying the intersection of the anterior lambdoid and coronal sutures with the sagittal suture to position the center of the VOI on the sagittal plane and localizing the VOI center on the coronal plane at the sagittal suture. After applying a global threshold, an erosion of one pixel was performed to eliminate partial volume effects. The following parameters were then calculated: total volume (TV, defined as the VOI), bone volume (BV, defined as the volume within the VOI occupied by bone), bone volume fraction (BV/TV, defined as the proportion of the VOI occupied by bone, expressed as a percentage), cross-sectional bone thickness (Cs.Th, measured as the thickness of the calvaria from the edge of cortical bone underlying the scalp to overlying the meninges, calculated in 2D on the basis of the plate model), and tissue mineral density (TMD, determined by\ncalibration of the attenuation values to those obtained from the HA rods).     The content for this dataset was extracted from a meta-analysis performed by the authors of Fu et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00147-7). The purpose of the meta-analysis was to mine the literature in order to quantify microgravity-induced changes to bone health in animals. The authors provided to ALSDA a global dataset, based upon 40 different literature-derived articles. In collaboration with the authors and the ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG), these datasets were then parsed into individual 'original' files of data. This 'original' data file is made available (so users can see original version). To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Of note, these values are groups of sample, with 'sample name 1' (group 1) having an N of 7, and 'sample name 2' (group 2) having an N of 8.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Description": "Bone growth may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven 23-week-old, adult female wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight female littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 murine calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), average cortical thickness (Ct.Th), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the spaceflight (SF) group compared to that of the ground control (GC) group, the mean BV ± SD for the SF group was 1.904 ± 0.842 mm3, compared to 1.758 ± 0.122 mm3 for the GC group (p less than 0.05). Ct.Th demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ± 0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ± 0.005 mm in the SF group (p equals 0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ± 0.029 g/cm3 for the GC group and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cm3 for the SF group (p equals 0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes responsive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone adaptation independent of skeletal loading by tissue. This dataset was derived from the literature, and contains only grouped mCT data from the calvaria.",

This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Frozen serum aliquots were shipped to Alamar Biosciences (Fremont, CA).     The NULISA-seq Inflammation Panel was performed, which targets 124 cytokines/chemokines and 80 other proteins related to immune response. NGS data were processed using the NULISAseq algorithm (Alamar Biosciences). The sample- (SMI) and target-specific (TMI) barcodes were quantified, and up to two mismatching bases or one indel and one mismatch were allowed. Intraplate normalization was performed by dividing the target counts for each sample well by that well’s internal control (mCherry) counts. Interplate normalization was performed using interplate control (IPC) normalization, in which counts were divided by target-specific medians of the three IPC wells on that plate, and then rescaled by the factor 10^4. To facilitate statistical analyses, IPC-normalized counts were log2-transformed to form a more normal distribution. These log2 IPC-normalized counts are referred to as NULISA Protein Quantification (NPQ) units. Methods for data processing and normalization were extracted from Feng et al 2023 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.09.536130v2.full.pdf).     Frozen serum samples were submitted to Eve Technologies (Calgary, Canada) for biomarker profiling.

The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included whole blood collected via venipuncture, with serum extracted from blood using a serum separator tube (SST). Samples were collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and post-flight (R+1, R+45, R+82). Serum samples were submitted for immune and cardiovascular cytokine biomarker profiling panels at two different companies (Eve Technologies and Alamar), and to Quest Diagnostics for comprehensive metabolic panel testing. Data was used to measure changes in cytokines and metabolic measures during spaceflight.

          "Study Protocol Description": "C57BL/6 female mice (16-week-old, Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS as part of NASA’s 1st RR-1 on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft . During flight, animals were kept at an ambient temperature of 26 to 28 degrees C in a 12-hour light and dark cycle. Flight animals received water and a food bar diet specifically designed by NASA ad libitum. RR-1 mission animals were on board of the Dragon capsule for 4 days (transit time) and then spent 37 days in the ISS. Animals were kept in similar conditions to flight animals (ambient temperature of 26 to 28 degrees C in a 12-hour light and dark cycle). Telemetry data (with a 4-day delay) from the flight group was used to keep the ground control animals under similar conditions (housed in RR-1 flight hardware within an environmental simulator under the same conditions as the ISS). Water and food conditions were the same as to the flight animal group as described above. Animals in the vivarium group were control animals that were housed under standard laboratory conditions. In addition, animals in the baseline group consisted of mice from the same cohorts as the flight mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch.     Within 4 hours of splashdown, flight and ground control animals were sacrificed and brains were removed and dissected. For the study focusing on the forebrain, microdissections of the entire hippocampus and primary motor cortex were performed following well-established rodent brain microdissection protocols, and a brain atlas served as a reference to ensure accuracy of brain region identification. Following brain dissection, samples were stored at −80 degrees Celsius until further analysis. Tissues used in this study consisted of brain tissue, minus the cortex and hippocampus. Brain tissue samples were obtained from by the authors through an award from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC).     Brain lysates were run and resolved in 4–20% Criterion TGX Stain-Free precast gels (Bio-Rad) at 300V.     Samples were transferred via a TransBlot turbo using a PVDF transfer membrane. The transfer lasted seven minutes in duration.     All membranes were blocked using I-Block overnight at four degrees Celsius.     Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against caspase-1 (Novus Biologicals), ASC (Santa Cruz), IL-1beta (Cell Signaling) at a dilution of 1:1000. b-actin (Sigma Aldric) was used as a standard and protein loading control.     Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies against caspase-1 (Novus Biologicals), ASC (Santa Cruz), IL-1beta (Cell Signaling) at a dilution of 1:1000. b-actin (Sigma Aldric) was used as a standard and protein loading control. All primary antibodies used a mouse antigen host and underwent two five minute washes with I-Block at room temperature.     All secondary Anti-Mouse HRP antibodies used a goat antigen host. The membranes then underwent one five minute wash and two ten minute washes with I-Block at room temperature.     The western Blots were imaged through chemilluminescence for one minute using the ChemiDoc Touch Gel Imaging System.     The Western Blots were quantified using the Silk Scientific Corporation UN- SCAN-IT gel software.     Each image contains the twenty sample lanes labeled left to right: Vivarium 1 (M16), Ground 1 (M36), Baseline 1 (M6), Flight 1 (M26), Vivarium 2 (M17), Ground 2 (M37), Baseline 2 (M7), Flight 2 (M27), Vivarium 3 (M18), Ground 3 (M38), Baseline 3 (M8) , Flight 3 (M28), Vivarium 4 (M19), Ground 4 (M39), Baseline 4 (M9), Flight 4 (M29), Vivarium 5 (M20), Ground 5 (M40), Baseline 5 (M10), Flight 5 (M30).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. The transformed column headers and the submitted term from which they derive are defined in the study data dictionary file.     Using protein lysates, a V-PLEX ECLIA kit (MSD) was used to measure the inflammatory profile in the different brain sections using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM (MSD).     Briefly, to measure the protein levels of TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10, after washing steps, the plate was incubated overnight with 50 uL of samples. The following day, after washing steps, samples were incubated in detection antibody for 2 hrs followed by 3 more washings steps and addition of 2X Read Buffer. After obtaining the quantity of protein in pg/mL using using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM, samples were then normalized to total protein loaded.",

In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from September 21st, 2014, to October 25th, 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice. This dataset derives results from the ECLIA and Western Blot assays using brain tissue.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Flight animals were sacrificed 4-6 hours after landing. Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats (n equals 18) were evaluated. The ovary-intact animals represent reserve rats to be used if the originally planned flight had been delayed. Since the mission was carried out as anticipated, these animals were maintained in a vivarium and sacrificed to provide age-matched reference values for baseline (n equals 8, 12 weeks old) and flight (n equals 10, 14 weeks old). The purpose of the ovary-intact controls was 2-fold: 1) to evaluate normal age-related changes in bone over the 2 week flight period, and 2) to verify that ovariectomies (OVX) resulted in anticipated cancellous osteopenia. This dataset is only the data from OVX animals. All rats were sacrificed by decapitation and bones were harvested and placed in 70% ethanol for analysis.     Second lumbar vertebrae from 11 rats per group were available for evaluation. The bones were prepared for histological analysis as described. In brief, specimens were dehydrated in increased concentrations of ethanol and embedded in a mixture of methyl methacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate (in a 12.5:1 ratio). Five-micrometer-thin sections were then cut on a microtome (model 2065, Reichert-Jung, Heidelberg, Germany) and stained with toluidine blue (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA). The staining technique allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and fluorochrome label.\n\nThe effects of spaceflight on bone resorption and osteoblast turnover were evaluated using a novel approach. Specifically, the preflight fluorochrome label was used to identify bone perimeter undergoing mineralization in preflight animals experiencing normal weight bearing. Because preflight fluorochrome label perimeter is assumed to be similar in the rats randomly assigned to a group (ground control or flight), post-flight differences in label length represent intergroup differences in bone resorption during flight. In turn, the perimeter bounded by preflight label with adjacent osteoblasts represents continuous bone formation throughout the duration of flight, whereas fluorochrome label with no adjacent osteoblasts reflects sites undergoing bone mineralization at the time of label administration but not subsequently (ceased bone formation). In contrast, bone perimeter bounded by osteoblasts with no adjacent label represents sites where bone formation was newly initiated during flight (i.e., following administration of the preflight label). Cell and fluorochrome data were simultaneously collected by viewing the sections under combined visible light and ultraviolet light using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Atlanta, GA, USA). Endpoints evaluated included bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, area of total\ntissue evaluated occupied by cancellous bone, %), fluorochrome label length (length/tissue area, mm/mm2) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast\nperimeter/bone perimeter, %). Fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation included measurements of continuous bone formation during\nflight (percentage of bone lined with osteoblasts associated with the single label; %), ceased bone formation during flight (percentage of bone\nperimeter with label not associated with osteoblasts, %), newly initiated bone formation during flight (percentage of osteoblast perimeter not\nassociated with label, %) and mineral apposition rate (mean distance between the fluorochrome marker and osteoblast-lined perimeter divided\nby number of days between the label injection and killing (15 days), μm/day). MAT (% tissue area) and adipocyte number ( /mm2) were measured and adipocyte size (μm2) was determined by dividing MAT by adipocyte number.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a bone histomorphometry data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures/parameters). This enables all histomorphometry results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Twelve-week-old female Fischer 344 rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were used in the study. The animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocol was approved by the NASA and Mayo Clinic Animal Care and Use Committees. The rats were ovx 14 days prior to launch and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) ground-based flight control (ground control, n equals 12), or 2) spaceflight (flight, n equals 12). The flight animals were flown on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-62) for 14 days. Flight and ground control animals were housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM) with 6 rats/AEM. The AEMs were maintained at 28 °C. All animals were provided with food (Teklad L356 food bars; Teklad Inc., Madison, WI) and water ad libitum.",

          "Study Description": "There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n equals 11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts. This dataset derives results from the bone histomorphometry assay.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Within 4 hours of splashdown, flight and ground control animals were sacrificed and brains were removed and dissected. For the study focusing on the forebrain, microdissections of the entire hippocampus and primary motor cortex were performed following well-established rodent brain microdissection protocols, and a brain atlas served as a reference to ensure accuracy of brain region identification. Following brain dissection, samples were stored at −80 degrees Celsius until further analysis. Tissues used in this study consisted of the brain hippocampus. Brain tissue samples were obtained from by the authors through an award from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC).     C57BL/6 female mice (16-week-old, Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS as part of NASA’s 1st RR-1 on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft. During flight, animals were kept at an ambient temperature of 26 to 28C in a 12-hour light and dark cycle. Flight animals received water and a food bar diet specifically designed by NASA ad libitum. RR-1 mission animals were on board of the Dragon capsule for 4 days (transit time) and then spent 37 days in the ISS. Animals in the vivarium group were control animals that were housed under standard laboratory conditions. In addition, animals in the baseline group consisted of mice from the same cohorts as the flight mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch.     Using protein lysates, a V-PLEX ECLIA kit (MSD) was used to measure the inflammatory profile in the different brain sections using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM (MSD).     Briefly, to measure the protein levels of TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10, after washing steps, the plate was incubated overnight with 50 uL of samples. The following day, after washing steps, samples were incubated in detection antibody for 2 hrs followed by 3 more washings steps and addition of 2X Read Buffer. After obtaining the quantity of protein in pg/mL using using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM, samples were then normalized to total protein loaded.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. The transformed column headers and the submitted term from which they derive are defined in the study data dictionary file.",

In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from September 21st, 2014, to October 25th, 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice. This dataset derives results from the ECLIA assay using brain tissue.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "After removing the surrounding soft tissue, the left femur was wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and stored at −20 °C for ex vivo microCT analysis and biomechanical testing, whereas the right femur was stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for dynamic histomorphometry. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the IACUC.     The frozen left femurs were thawed and subjected to three-point bending (Instron 8511 MTS, Instron, Norwood, MA). To determine the femoral stiffness (N·mm2), maximum moment (N·mm), and failure moment (N·mm), each femur was loaded to failure on the posterior surface at a constant displacement rate of 3mm/min with the two lower supports spaced 20 mm apart. Force-displacement data were acquired at 100 Hz. Estimated elastic modulus (MPa) was calculated using the moment of inertia derived from microCT scans.     Microcomputed tomographic (μCT) imaging was performed on the distal metaphysis and mid-diaphysis of the femur, using a high-resolution desktop imaging system (μCT40, Scanco Medical AG, Brttisellen, Switzerland) in accordance with the published guidelines for the use of μCT in rodents. Scans were acquired using a 15 μm3 isotropic voxel size, 70 kVp and 114 mA peak x-ray tube potential and intensity, 300 ms integration time, and were subjected to Gaussian filtration. We determined femoral length by measuring the distance from the femoral head to the distal end of femoral condyles on μCT scans. The distal metaphyseal region that we analyzed began 600 μm proximal to the distal growth plate and extended proximally 2.1mm. Cortical bone morphology was evaluated in the femoral mid-diaphysis in a region that started 55% of the bone length below the femoral head and extended 1050 μm distally.     Global thresholds of 360 and 700 mg HA/cm3 were used for evaluation of trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Trabecular bone outcomes included trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV, mm3/mm3), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and separation (mm). Cortical bone outcomes included cortical tissue mineral density (Ct.TMD, mg HA/cm3), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, μm), total cross-sectional and cortical bone areas (Tt.Ar, Ct.Ar, mm2), cortical bone area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %), and the maximum and minimum moments of inertia (Imax and Imin, mm4)     To examine BFR, calcein (25 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at 10 and 3 days prior to sacrifice. Longitudinal 5-μm thick undecalcified plastic sections were used to measure static and dynamic parameters in trabecular bone in the distal metaphyseal femur, using OsteoMeasure software (Osteometrics; n equals 5/group). For static histomorphometry, osteo- blast (Ob.S/BS) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS) along the trabecular bone was measured. For dynamic histomorphometry, mineralizing surface per bone surface (MS/BS, %) and MAR (μm/day) were measured on unstained sections to calculate BFR (μm3/μm2/day) according to ASBMR guidelines.     Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing 408 ± 0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22 ± 2 °C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. Water and chow were provided ad libitum. Throughout the experiment, rats were assessed daily for any signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyrin staining around eyes, poor grooming, and/or hair loss), harness and jacket fitting, ability to walk and move across the cage, as well as food and water intake. At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and hind limbs were harvested. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the IACUC.  Animals were assigned to one of four groups: normal loading (PWB100), and 70% (PWB70), 40% (PWB40), and 20% (PWB20) of normal loading via quadrupedal suspension. These PWB groups were chosen to mimic gravitational forces on Earth (1 G), moderate artificial gravity (0.7 G), Mars (0.4 G), and Moon (0.2 G). Animals were assigned to experimental groups based on pre-PWB body weight to ensure similar average and variability in body weight across all groups. Groups were suspended for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals  11–12/group). Rats were assigned to each group to ensure balanced distribution of the body weight across all groups. After 2 days of acclimation in custom cages and jackets, rats were suspended according to their PWB groups. Rats were secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness and submitted to a two-point suspension allowing them to adopt a normal quadrupedal behavior, while weighing 100, 70, 40, or 20% of their body weight. Animals were weighed daily in their PWB apparatus and the chain link to the two-point suspension was adjusted if needed to ensure that their achieved unloading level remained constant based on PWB groups.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Description": "Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the Mechanical Testing, Bone Microstructure (microCT), and bone histomorphometry assays using femur tissue.",

Urine aliquots were thawed and processed with the NULISAseq 200plex v1 Inflammation Panel (Feng et al.) with two technical replicates (10uL each) per sample. This panel includes 203 targets spanning cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins related to immune response. NGS data were processed using the NULISAseq algorithm (Alamar Biosciences). The sample- (SMI) and target-specific (TMI) barcodes were quantified, and up to two mismatching bases or one indel and one mismatch were allowed. Intraplate normalization was performed by dividing the target counts for each sample well by that well’s internal control (mCherry) counts. Interplate normalization was performed using interplate control (IPC) normalization, in which counts were divided by target-specific medians of the three IPC wells on that plate, and then rescaled by the factor 10^4. To facilitate statistical analyses, IPC-normalized counts were log2-transformed to form a more normal distribution. These log2 IPC-normalized counts are referred to as NULISA Protein Quantification (NPQ) units. Methods for data processing and normalization were extracted from Feng et al 2023 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.09.536130v2.full.pdf).

One of these biospecimen collections included urine from pre-flight and post-flight/recovery timepoints (L-92, L-44, L-3, R+1, R+45, R+82). 203 inflammatory, cytokine, and chemokine proteins were quantified using NULISAseq. This study derives results from the Multiplex assay, and the urine data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-569 (whole blood), OSD-570 (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), OSD-571 (plasma), OSD-572 (skin, oral, and nasal swabs),  OSD-573 (Dragon capsule samples), OSD-574 (skin biopsy), OSD-575 (serum), and OSD-630 (stool).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The baseline group was sacrificed on day of launch. Flight animals were sacrificed 4-6 hours after landing. Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats (n equals 18) were evaluated. The ovary-intact animals represent reserve rats to be used if the originally planned flight had been delayed. Since the mission was carried out as anticipated, these animals were maintained in a vivarium and sacrificed to provide age-matched reference values for baseline (n equals 8, 12 weeks old) and flight (n equals 10, 14 weeks old). The purpose of the ovary-intact controls was 2-fold: 1) to evaluate normal age-related changes in bone over the 2 week flight period, and 2) to verify that ovariectomies (OVX) resulted in anticipated cancellous osteopenia. This dataset is only the data from OVX animals. All rats were sacrificed by decapitation and bones were harvested and placed in 70% ethanol for analysis.     Micro-computed Tomography was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of bone volume and cortical and cancellous bone microarchitecture. Femora, humeri, 2nd lumbar vertebrae, and right calvaria were scanned using a Scanco mCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at 55 kVp x-ray\nvoltage, 145 milliampere intensity, and 200 ms integration time. Femora, humeri, and right calvaria were scanned at a voxel size of 12micron × 12 micron × 12 micron while 2nd lumbar vertebrae were scanned at a voxel size of 16 micron × 16 micron × 16 micron. Cortical bone was evaluated in the femur and humerus diaphyses. Cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, in the distal humerus epiphysis, and in the vertebral body. Calvarial thickness was evaluated in a subsection of the parietal bone.\n\n\nFemur. Eighty-two slices (984 micrometers in length) of cortical bone were assessed in the femur mid-diaphysis. All cortical slices were examined visually for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex (extremely rare at this site) and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross-sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3) and cortical thickness (micrometers). Three-dimensional cortical volume measurements\nwere converted to two-dimensional area measurements. Polar moment of inertia (mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Seventy four slices (888 micrometers in length) of cancellous bone, 150 slices (1,800 micrometers in length) proximal to the growth plate, were assessed in the distal femur metaphysis. The entire cancellous bone compartment (64 plus-minus 1 slices, 768 plus-minus 12micrometers) was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis. Direct\ncancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, percent), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, mm-3; this index detects defects in cancellous architecture), structure model index (an architectural index defining bone as plate-like or rod-like with values ranging from 0 to 3, respectively), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, micrometers), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, mm-1) and trabecular separation (distance between trabeculae, micrometers).\n\n\nHumerus. Twenty slices (240 micrometers in length) of cortical bone were evaluated in the humerus diaphysis. The entire cancellous compartment (65 plus-minus 1 slices, 780 plus-minus 12 micrometers in length) was evaluated in the distal humerus epiphysis. Cortical and cancellous bone measurements were the same as those described for the femur.\n\n\nLumbar vertebra. Analysis of the lumbar vertebra included the entire region of cancellous bone in the vertebral body between the cranial and caudal growth plates (238 plus-minus 2 slices, 3808 plus-minus 32 micrometers in length). Cancellous bone measurements were the same as those described for the distal femur.\n\n\nCalvarium. Calvarial thickness (micrometers) was measured in the parietal bone in a 1.2 × 2.4 mm rectangle starting 1.8 mm rostral to the lambdoid suture, and midway between the sagittal suture and temporal crest.     Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from non-bone. Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0-1000).     Twelve-week-old female Fischer 344 rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were used in the study. The animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocol was approved by the NASA and Mayo Clinic Animal Care and Use Committees. The rats were ovx 14 days prior to launch and randomly assigned to one of three treatment\ngroups: 1) baseline control (baseline, n equals 6), 2) ground-based flight control (ground control, n equals 12), or 3) spaceflight (flight, n equals 12). The flight animals were flown on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-62) for 14 days. Flight and ground control animals were housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM) with 6 rats/AEM. The AEMs were maintained at 28 °C. All animals were provided with food\n(Teklad L356 food bars; Teklad Inc., Madison, WI) and water ad libitum.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Description": "This study investigated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, density and microarchitecture in weight bearing (femur and humerus) and non-weight bearing (2nd) lumbar vertebra and calvarium) bones in the context of ovarian hormone insufficiency. 12-week-old Fisher 344 rats were ovariectomized 2 weeks before flight and randomized into one of three groups: 1) baseline (n equals 6), 2) ground control (n equals 12) or 3) spaceflight (n equals 12). Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats provided age-matched reference values at baseline (n equals 8) and landing (n equals 10). Ovariectomy resulted in bone- and bone compartment-specific deficits in cancellous bone volume fraction. Spaceflight resulted in lower cortical bone accrual in the femur but had no effect on cortical bone in the humerus or calvarium. Cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to ground control animals in lumbar vertebra and distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis; significant differences were not detected in the distal humerus. Bone loss (compared to baseline controls) in the femur metaphysis was associated with lower trabecular number, whereas trabecular thickness and number were lower in the epiphysis. This dataset is only for the ovariectomized animals. In summary, the effect of spaceflight on bone microarchitecture in ovariectomized rats was bone-and bone compartment-specific but not strictly related to weight bearing. This dataset derives results from the micro–computed tomography (mCT) assay.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Subjects were Sprague–Dawley (S–D, Taconic Farms) rats weighing 201–225g at the start of the experiment and housed in animal facilities accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Five days following irradiation the rats were shipped to the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) for training and testing. The facilities at UMBC are supervised by the Veterinary Services Department of the University of Maryland, Baltimore Medical School. At both facilities subjects were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle in a temperature and humidity controlled room. Experiments were completed during the light phase of the cycle. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of both BNL and UMBC.     Rats were radiated with 56Fe particles (1000 MeV/n) at a nominal dose rate of 100 cGy/min at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL. For irradiation, rats were placed in well-ventilated clear plastic restraining tubes. Exposure was done from the side of the rat using a non-collimated 20 cm diameter beam. The tubes were positioned so that the head of the rat was located in the center of the beam as determined by an X-ray of the setup. The body of the rat was shielded by tungsten blocks, limiting exposure to the head and neck. Rats were not anesthetized during irradiation, which may have produced restraint stress. However, it is unlikely that stress affected the results of the experiments because behavioral testing did not begin until 2–3 months following exposure. Dosimetry was performed by the staff of the NSRL. Control rats were taken to the NSRL but not irradiated. For the first experiment, rats were exposed to different doses of 56Fe particles: 0cGy (control non-irradiated [n equals 8]), 50cGy (n equals 8), 80cGy (n equals 9), 100cGy (n equals 8), 150 cGy (n equals 8) and 200 cGy (n equals 9).For the second experiment 112 experimentally naive male S–D rats weighing 250–275 g at time of radiation were exposed to 150 cGy of 56Fe particles. The sample sizes were 10 rats in each diet group and eight rats in each diet control group. GeneLab calculated exposure duration based on absorbed radiation dose and dose rate.     Experiments were completed during the light phase of the cycle. Subjects were tested in an open field composed of black Plexiglas (93 cm  93 cm). The open field and the objects were cleaned with dilute alcohol after each subject. During the experiment the arena was dimly illuminated by a 25 watt bulb.     Subjects were tested in an open field composed of black Plexiglas (93 cm  93 cm). The two stimulus objects were ceramic figurines that varied in shape, color, and size. They were no smaller than a rat and no larger than two and a half times the size of a rat. Velcro was used to secure the objects in position. On the test day (24 h later) the familiar object and a novel object were placed into the arena. The location of the two objects was randomly counter-balanced across trials to prevent responding on the basis of location. Exploration was scored as above.     The subjects were first habituated by placing them in the apparatus for two consecutive days for 5 min on each day in the absence of the stimulus objects. A single trial was run on both conditioning and test days. On the conditioning day, identical stimulus objects were placed in symmetrical locations in the open field. The rat was placed in the center of the arena (about 30 cm from the front wall and 45 cm from the side walls) with its nose facing the objects. The rat was allowed to explore the stimuli until it accumulated 30 s total object exploration (i.e., exploration of either object) or until 20 min had passed. Object exploration time was scored only when the rat’s nose was within 1 cm of the object (but not touching it) and the vibrissae moving.     The rat was allowed to explore the stimuli until it accumulated 30 s total object exploration (i.e., exploration of either object) or until 20 min had passed. Object exploration time was scored only when the rat’s nose was within 1 cm of the object (but not touching it) and the vibrissae moving.     The original submitted data was processed by the LBL/UCB Predictive Modeling Project funded by NASA (Senior investigators: Andy Wyrobek, Ana Mora and Ben Brown). Multiple emails were exchanged with Dr. Rabin (original study PI) to clarify any inconsistencies in dates, animal identifiers, and a few behavioral outcome values that were out of range or had been calculated incorrectly. Data sets were formatted so that they could be merged. These files also contain categories that are specific to the predictive modeling parameters used by the LBL/UCB team.

This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. For the original submitted files, animals are separated into two different years based on the year in which they were irradiated at NSRL, but the current study uses subjects from both years.",

          "Study Description": "On long-duration missions to other planets astronauts will be exposed to types and doses of radiation that are not experienced in low earth orbit. Previous research using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays has shown that exposure to heavy particles, such as 56Fe, disrupts spatial learning and memory measured using the Morris water maze. Maintaining rats on diets containing antioxidant phytochemicals for 2 weeks prior to irradiation ameliorated this deficit. The present experiments were designed to determine: (1) the generality of the particle-induced disruption of memory by examining the effects of exposure to 56Fe particles on object recognition memory; and (2) whether maintaining rats on these antioxidant diets for 2 weeks prior to irradiation would also ameliorate any potential deficit. The results showed that exposure to low doses of 56Fe particles does disrupt recognition memory and that maintaining rats on antioxidant diets containing blueberry and strawberry extract for only 2 weeks was effective in ameliorating the disruptive effects of irradiation. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms by which exposure to these particles may produce effects on neurocognitive performance. This study derives behavior results from the novel object recognition assay. The original data derived from this study by Rabin et al. was transformed and used as part of a predictive modeling study by Dr. Mora, Dr. Wyrobek, Dr. Ben Brown et al.

Scans were performed using a voxel size of 100 μm and a scanning beam thickness of 500 μm. Daily calibration was performed using a manufacturer-supplied hydroxyapatite phantom. Transverse images of right tibia were acquired at 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 mm (for total and trabecular vBMD), and at 20 and 20.5 mm (for cortical vBMD) from the proximal tibial plateau. During the scan, rats were under isoflurane-induced anesthesia.\n\nLongitudinal images were visually inspected, and matched based on the distance from the proximal tibial plateau and shape of the proximal tibial metaphysis and fibula to ensure anatomically consistent location for analysis. Scanned slices were analyzed using Stratec software (Stratec XCT Analysis System, v6.0, Norland Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI), using a standardized analysis to determine cortical (contour mode 1, peel mode 2, outer and inner threshold of 0.650 g/cm3) and trabecular (contour mode 3, peel mode 4, outer threshold of 0.450 g/cm3, inner threshold of 0.800 g/cm3) vBMD.     Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing 408 ± 0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22 ± 2 °C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. Water and chow were provided ad libitum. Throughout the experiment, rats were assessed daily for any signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyrin staining around eyes, poor grooming, and/or hair loss), harness and jacket fitting, ability to walk and move across the cage, as well as food and water intake. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the IACUC.\n\nAnimals were assigned to one of four groups: normal loading (PWB100), and 70% (PWB70), 40% (PWB40), and 20% (PWB20) of normal loading via quadrupedal suspension. These PWB groups were chosen to mimic gravitational forces on Earth (1 G), moderate artificial gravity (0.7 G), Mars (0.4 G), and Moon (0.2 G). Animals were assigned to experimental groups based on pre-PWB body weight to ensure similar average and variability in body weight across all groups. Groups were suspended for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals  11–12/group). Rats were assigned to each group to ensure balanced distribution of the body weight across all groups. After 2 days of acclimation in custom cages and jackets, rats were suspended according to their PWB groups. Rats were secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness and submitted to a two-point suspension allowing them to adopt a normal quadrupedal behavior, while weighing 100, 70, 40, or 20% of their body weight. Animals were weighed daily in their PWB apparatus and the chain link to the two-point suspension was adjusted if needed to ensure that their achieved unloading level remained constant based on PWB groups.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Description": "Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the pQCT assay using tibia tissue.",
